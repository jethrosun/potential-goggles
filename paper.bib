The desig of framework mainly comprises of a gateway that all the traffic to and from IoT devices are enforced to pass through. Via the gateway, IoT devices can selectively use remote attestation and virtual drivers (virtual network functions) to secure their network traffic. 
Adv: (1) deadbolt controls and enforces necessary security features, which minimize the threat surface that exposed to a remote attack. (2) the proposed "virtual security driver" is interesting because it seems to be a feasible and scalable solution.  
Disadv: (1) The evaluation of the architecture and design is not through -- the work is only half done and is not a full conference paper. Thus, the paper didn't justify the architecture of having a gateway deployed is feasible. Further, the paper didn't jusitfy the abstraction of virtual security driver is scalable etc.}

annote = {ClickOS (2014) is a framework that could build NFV based S/W middleboxes focused VM. Note that the targeted environments are commodity h/w with 10G NICs. ClickOS is built upon the Xen virtualization techniques w/ certain optimization which means it is not feasible for KVM or OVS ecosystem. The work is trying to prove that NFV with commodity h/w is feasible so it didn't test real  NFV applications. Also, the ClickOS uses a simpler programming abstraction (borrowed from Click router) so that it would be easier to deal with the deisgn and architecture. 
Adv: (1) The programming abstraction is simple -- the ClickOS uses the abstraction from Click routers to represent all the networking functions. (2) The evaluation is very sound. The authors managed to show that via carefully tunning of the Xen virtualization you can build and use ClickOS VMs and being able to saturate the 10G NICs. 
Disadv: (1) ClickOS is built upon Xen, which means that it certainly won't work with KVM or OVS ecosystem. (Bummer!) (2) To only prove that NFV with leveraging commodity h/w is feasible, the scopoe of this work is limitted to simple and naive functionalities. "Naturally, some of these middleboxes fall short of be- ing fully functional, and different configurations (e.g., a large number of firewall rules) would cause their perfor- mance to drop from what we present here."}
